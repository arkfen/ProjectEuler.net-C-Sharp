# ProjectEuler.net-C-Sharp
Solutions for Project Euler tasks using my lovely C# and most straight forward way of coding I like as much as possible... I believe that code should be as human readable as possible and there should be no optimization for speed unless it is really needed. Computers are fast and we should think about people first!

 Again, I am aware that there are cases when we need optimize to cut the time of very long processes - we will try to do it of course. But let's have some balance and decided each time which solution is going to be the best in each case.
